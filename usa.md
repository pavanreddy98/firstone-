     it is one of the top 50 univeraities,
     it has  very less student to faculty ratio 22:1 , so there is great interaction between students and proffesor
     very instresting subjects are thought here which matches my area of intrest,university gives chance of reasearch during graduation , northwest missouri state university is well known for acedamic excellence , updating the course structure and subjects according to the market needs.teaching hot technologies, and university also has some recognised community service programs .
     and i have also done research with few current students ,they said that proffessors really take  care of students for development of the skills , all this reasons impressed me to choose northwest west 

19. why do you want to study in usa and why in missouri?
    
     United states of america has the most number of international students in the world.
     usa has  unique curriculum ,quality of education ,multi cultural environment and also usa education is mostly on  practical exposure rather than on theory.
     usa universities helps students to do reasearch , and also provides internships this will increase the skill set and also get to known about the industry level experience at the graduate level itself 
     these are the some of the reason why i choose to study in usa.

     i am not too specific about the place i specific abou the university which offer the subjects what i am instereted
